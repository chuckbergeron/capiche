Capiche
=======

Capiche is a relatively simple Capistrano recipe for deployment to Apis Networks, using relative symlinks instead of absolute ones. It supports the following:

    * A schematic for relative symlinks
    * A directory for the site owner to upload PDFs and other assets to, via FTP
    * Mirroring the production database to the development machine (for debugging a site locally) 


Example
=======

1. capify .
2. ./script/plugin install 
3. cap deploy

Simple!



Thanks
